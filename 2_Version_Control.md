# Version control

The process of monitoring and managing changes to software code is known as version control, also commonly referred to as source control. Software technologies called version control systems assist software development teams in tracking changes to source code over time. Version control systems enable software teams to operate more swiftly and intelligently as development environments have increased. They are especially helpful for DevOps teams because they enable them to speed up successful deployments and cut down on development time.

Every change to the code is recorded by version control software in a particular form of database. If a mistake is made, programmers can go back in time and review prior iterations of the code to help fix it while causing the least amount of interruption to the entire team.
