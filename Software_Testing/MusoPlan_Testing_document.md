## 3. Testing the "Calculate troupe deployment rate" functionality. (testing done on 12 august 2022 )

Type "4" from the menu presented and press enter, you should be prompted to provide a troupe name of between 3 to 30 characters. Please note that you should have added a musician to any troupe of choice before attempting to calculate a troupe deployment rate. It is illogical to choose this option when there is no muscian added to the troupe of interest as a troupe deployment rate is calculated from the hourly rate of the musicians it comprises of. if the right inputs are supplied up to here, you are prompted to enetr a valid troupe name - meaning that the troupe must have been created. From here, you are to enter the booking duration between 0.5 to 3 hours. **The troupe booking time must be between 0.5 to 3 hours and the troupe must exist to get a value for the rate of deployment!** If all inputs meet the set requirements, the landing menu is represented to select another action to be performed from options 1-9.
